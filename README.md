# Code Playground

This project was downloaded from Whimsical Animations, a course from Josh W. Comeau.

## Setup Instructions

First, install dependencies using NPM (or whichever package manager you use):

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile the project and serve it at `http://localhost:5173` by default. If this port is already in use, a different port will be chosen automatically. You can check the terminal for the local URL.

## Support

If you run into any issues running a local development server, feel free to ask for help in our community Discord!

To set expectations: I don’t really consider this functionality a “core” part of the course. Exercises are mainly intended to run on the course platform itself. I added this “download” ability for advanced users who want to use their own IDE.

So, I’m happy to take a quick look and give you any suggestions I have off the top of my head, but that’s about the extent of the support I plan on offering.

This project uses Vite, so if you do run into any issues, the Vite documentation is a good place to start!
